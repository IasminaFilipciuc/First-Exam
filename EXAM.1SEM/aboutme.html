     <h4>Helloow !</h4>
    <h4>My name is Iasmina Filipciuc, I'm 19 and I'm from Romania from a tiny town named Suceava. I see myself as a friendly, kind and helpful person. I'll always be there for parties and funny moments but when I have to be serious at school, I really am. Also, I love to take part in extracurricular activities and to learn new things every day. One defect of mine is that I'm almost always late and in this way I would like to tell teachers that I'm sorry because I'm late for classes every morning. I'll never be absent, I'll just be late. One thing that I would like to do all my life is to travel. I want to see the entire world, every country, every city, every village. The world has so much to show us like traditions, habits, beautiful places, people who have a kind soul. Yes, I want to discover all of this.</h4>
